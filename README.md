# user-manager-mongo
In compass make database called user-manager.

Make users collections.

in terminal in text editor of project type: node app.js.
it will take you to the create users page. You can either create a user and it will direct you or you can navigate to the user listing page. 

The initial page will be blank on the user listing until you make a user. I did not add default users :(
